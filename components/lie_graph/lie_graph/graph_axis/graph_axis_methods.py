Graph axis methods

Functions for traversing and querying (sub)graph hierarchy with respect
to a root node. These functions are similar to the axis methods commonly found
in XML libraries.

All these functions accept a (sub)graph, a node id (nid) to query axis based
hierarchy for and a root nid relative to which the hierarchy should be
defined.
