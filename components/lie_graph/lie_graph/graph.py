    *Graph root*
    By default a graph is an undirected and non-rooted network of nodes.
    Many graph methods however require the definition of a root relative to
    which a calculation will be performed.

    The graph class defines a `root` attribute for this purpose that is
    undefined by default. It will be set automatically in the following cases:

    * Node traversal: the first node selected (getnodes method) will be assigned
      root and traversal to `child` nodes will be done relative to the `root`.
      If multiple nodes are selected using `getnodes`, the root node is
      ambiguous and will be set to the node with the lowest nid.
